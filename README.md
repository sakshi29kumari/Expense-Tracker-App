# Expense-Tracker-App
This is a simple Expense Tracker Web App made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps you keep track of your income, expenses, and remaining balance in an easy way.
You can add your income and log all your daily expenses.
Every expense has a type, category, date, description, and amount.
The app will automatically calculate the remaining balance for you.
If you delete an expense, it won’t disappear completely – it will move to a Deleted History section, so you can still see it later.
All the data is saved in your browser (local storage), so even if you refresh the page, nothing is lost.
